nortlib2 consists of the portable elements of the old nortlib. The original
nortlib can be found at http://forge.abcd.harvard.edu/projects/arp-das/
as project QNX4/nortlib.

For installation from a distribution tarball, you should be able
to simply:

  ./configure
  make
  make install

When installing from the CVS repository, you will need
to run:

  aclocal
  libtoolize --automake
  automake --add-missing
  autoconf
  ./configure
  make
  make install

Please let me know if you have trouble with either of these
approaches.
