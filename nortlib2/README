For installation from a distribution tarball, you should be able
to simply:

  ./configure
  make
  make install

When installing from the CVS repository, you will need
to run:

  aclocal
  libtoolize --automake
  automake
  autoconf
  ./configure
  make
  make install

Please let me know if you have trouble with either of these
approaches.
