ModuleDef TMbase [ FREEMEM_RATE=1 SWSnot=# SWStat=SWStat Fnot=# Fail=Fail Panel= ] {
  Includes all the basic data definitions
  Creates TMbase.tbl with TMbase and TMbaseB tables
  Currently no configuration options, but cpu_usage and tmdf
  are both ripe for adaptation.
  
  FREEMEM_RATE is the data rate for the freemem TM channel
  SWStat is the variable name for a software status variable defined
         elsewhere.
  SWSnot defaults to a comment character. Define as empty to
         add the display of the SWStat variable in the TMbase_data
         table
  Fail   is the variable name for a fail status variable defined
         elsewhere
  Fnot   defaults to a comment character. Define as empty to
         add the display of the Fail variable in the TMbase_data
         table
  Panel  default to empty. Define when generating a tabbed interface
         for the MATLAB engineering application. For example, set
         Panel=HK: to assign the TMbase channels to the 'HK' panel.
