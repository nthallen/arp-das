tmcalgo - A quickly determined name intending to convey the idea that
this is the combination of the TMC data flow with command algorithms.

State Definition:
  State name {
    time_spec command
  }

  A time spec is either a time relative to the beginning of the
  present state or preceeded by "+" to designate time relative
  to the previous command.
  
  A command can be either a TMC statement (generally an "if" statement
  to check for a condition or a "validate" statement to switch to
  another state) or an instrument command.
  
  Instrument commands are executed once (of course) at the specified
  time offset.
  
  TMC statement are executed at a TMC-determined rate during the
  period of time for which they are valid.
  
  TMC statements should be listed after any instrument commands
  for the same time:

      3:00 > Lamp On							Correct
	       [ if (stat) validate Lamp_Not_On; ]

	  3:00 > Lamp On							Incorrect
		   [ if (stat) validate Lamp_Not_On; ]
		   > Lamp Set Point 395

  TMC statements listed prior to the first time specification
  are valid for the entire duration of the state. TMC statements
  with a time specification are valid from their specified time
  to the time of the next command. (This syntax is borderline:
  1 shift/reduce conflict, but shift is the correct action)
