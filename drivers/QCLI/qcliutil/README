qcli server modification for QNX6

QNX4 implementation attached a name and accepted commands and status requests from clients directly. It also requested a quit proxy from the command server.

QNX6 implementation will take advantage of the existing command architecture. It will read commands from cmd/QCLIn (where QCLIn can be set by commandline option) and it will write data to collection via synchronized Col_send(). Since both connections use file descriptors, the loop can be driven by select().

These are the commands I need to support:
#define qcli_select(n) qcliclt_send(QCLISRVR_SELECT, n, 0)
#define qcli_run() qcliclt_send(QCLISRVR_RUN, 0, 0)
#define qcli_stop() qcliclt_send(QCLISRVR_STOP, 0, 0)
#define qcli_clear() qcliclt_send(QCLISRVR_CLEAR, 0, 0)
#define qcli_set_ton(v) qcliclt_send(QCLISRVR_SET_PARAM, v, QCLISRVR_P_TON)
#define qcli_set_toff(v) qcliclt_send(QCLISRVR_SET_PARAM, v, QCLISRVR_P_TOFF)
#define qcli_set_tpre(v) qcliclt_send(QCLISRVR_SET_PARAM, v, QCLISRVR_P_TPRE)

SW:n select waveform n
RW run the currently selected waveform
ST stop running the waveform
CE clear errors
TN:v set Ton to v
TF:v set Toff to v
TP:v set Tpre to v
D0:v set DAC0 to v
D1:v
D2:v
D3:v
QU

Here we need a function that will read one command of the format above
and return the command and the optional value. In this case, the value is
always numeric, so doing the conversion while parsing makes some sense.
