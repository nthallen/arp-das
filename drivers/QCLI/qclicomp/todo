Use Unique.gnrc to make sure certain things can't be multiply
defined. Specifically {
  Only one Iz def is allowed
  Only one Tz def is allowed
  One Nsample or SampleRate must be defined
  Only one dI/dt is allowed

  Within a Ramp {
    Only one Istart is allowed
    Only one Istop is allowed
    At least one of Istart or Istop is required
    Only one Tramp is allowed
  }
}

Once the conditions are met, we need to propogate values.
