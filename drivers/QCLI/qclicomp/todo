Use Unique.gnrc to make sure certain things can't be multiply
defined. Specifically {
  Within a Ramp {
    Only one Istart is allowed
    Only one Istop is allowed
    Only one Tramp is allowed
    At least one of Istart or Istop is required
  }
}

Once the conditions are met, we need to propogate values.
Cases I need to handle {
  dI/dt specified {
    Istart & Tramp => calculate Istop
    Istop & Tramp  => calculate Istart
    Istart & Istop => calculate Tramp
  }
  dI/dt not specified {
    Istart & Istop & Tramp => calculate dI/dt
  }
  use defines_dIdt property of a waveform and a ramp
  Set to 1 when defined
  Count how many times it's defined using CONSTITUENTS ( dIdt.Key, ICOSRamp.Key )
  Complain if defined more than once or not at all.
}
