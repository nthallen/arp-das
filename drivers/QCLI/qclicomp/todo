  Tz specifies the laser-off time before AND after
  the ramps. Total off time is 2*Tz.
  
  Trecycle is carved out of the trailing Tz time,
  so in terms of the sample, the trailing Tz will be
  slightly shorter than the leading. This is based
  on the plan of using an asymetrical Ton/Toff pair
  to establish the primary stepsize. Stepsize=Ton+Toff
  and Toff = Trecycle.
  
  If we decided to go for an approach that repeated a
  ramp multiple times, we would want Toff to be even
  shorter (1usec say) to serve as the ramp reset duration.
  In that case, we might have to abandon it's use for
  Trecycle, and use the full Stepsize for that.
  
  
}
Trecycle {
  If Trecycle << Tz
  Trec_fullsteps = floor(Trecycle/Stepsize);
  Trec_rem = Trecycle % Stepsize;
  If this remainder is small compared to Tz (< Tz/5), we
  can carve it out of Tz by setting Toff = Trec_rem and
  Ton = Stepsize - Toff. This doubles the number of steps,
  but means we don't have to set a tiny Stepsize to achieve
  high on/off ratios. Obviously this makes the most sense
  when Trecycle << Stepsize. Actually, it really isn't
  worth it otherwise. So let's make the rules:
  Trcymin = IF( GE( Nsample_est, 16348 ), 200, 10 );
  SplitCycle = LT( MUL(4,Trcymin), Stepsize );
  Trcy = IF( SplitCycle,
			 0,
			 MUL( Stepsize, DIV_UP(Trcymin,Stepsize)) );
  Toff = IF( SplitCycle, Trcymin, Stepsize );
  Ton  = IF( SplitCycle, SUB(Stepsize, Toff), Toff );

	Liz wants information about nyquist frequency {
	  Nyquist frequency is just half the sample frequency,
	  but we're interested in wavenumber space in addition
	  to time space. Where the transform of time is
	  frequency, the transform of wavenumber is going to
	  be cm. In time, the Nyquist frequency is the
	  highest frequency (shortest time duration) that
	  can be resolved. In wavenumber, the Nyquist frequency
	  is the longest length (shortest wavenumber span)
	  that can be resolved.
	  
	  If Nf is the Nyquist frequency in time and TR is
	  the (average) tuning rate in cm-1/A, then the
	  Nyquist frequency in cm is:
	    Nf (samples/sec) / [TR (cm-1/A) * dI/dt (A/sec)]
	  This represents the highest frequency that can be
	  resolved, corresponding to the longest re-entry
	  length.
	  What you can actually resolve may be lower, since the
	  preamp/amplifier circuit may limit the temporal resolution
	  to less than the sample rate.

  Determine Tz, Trecycle
  Decide on a resolution {
    GCD of Tz and Tramp(s) is a good place to start,
	but when these aren't set explicitly, chances are
	there won't be an exact answer that fits.
	
	Suppose we establish a criteria of accuracy in time
	of 1% of the total specified cycle length meaning
	we will tolerate the actual Tz or Tramp being longer
	by up to 1% of the total specified cycle length.
	The largest step size possible would then be
	min(Tz,Tramp(s)) + .01*Tcycle
	
	Let Ti be all of the time lengths we're trying to hit
	ordered from smallest to largest. Let dT be our
	tolerance.

	  maxstep = floor((T0 + dT)/n);
	  minstep = ceil((T0 - dT)/n);
	  minmult = 1;
	  maxmult = 100;
	  for ( i = 1; minstep < maxstep && i < NT; i++ ) {
	    min_m = ceil(Ti/(T0+dT));
		max_m = floor((Ti+dT)/T0);
		minminstep = maxstep;
		maxmaxstep = minstep;
		for ( m = min_m; m <= max_m; m++ ) {
		  myminstep = ceil(Ti/m);
		  if ( myminstep < minminstep ) minminstep = myminstep;
		  mymaxstep = floor((Ti+dT)/m);
		  if ( mymaxstep > maxmaxstep ) maxmaxstep = mymaxstep;
		}
		if ( minminstep > minstep ) minstep = minminstep;
		if ( maxmaxstep < maxstep ) maxstep = maxmaxstep;
	  }
	  if ( minstep <= maxstep ) {
	    anything in this range will apparently work
	  }
	}
	
    but what is really going to be driving resolution
    is how short we want Trecycle to be. If we define
    resolution to be the number of steps in a compiled
    waveform, then resolution will be greater than or
    equal to Tcycle/min(Tz,Tramp,Trecycle). Presumably
    we will want Trecycle to be the shortest here, and
    if we want it to be less than 1%, say, then resolution
    will need to be greater than 100.

    If Trecycle were specified, then we could just use
    gcd(Tz,Tramp,Trecycle), but as a free parameter it
    gets trickier. We can start with gcd(Tz,Tramp). If
    that gives a resolution below 100, we need to look
    for a divisor that gets us into the right range.
    If that doesn't work, we need to arbitrarily choose
    a resolution in the right range.
    What's the right range? 100-300? Whatever.
	
	Current approach: Trecycle is carved out of the
	trailing Tz time and need not be considered for
	the purposes of determining resolution. Its
	magnitude only affects Nsample.

	stepsize = 0;
	Tcycle = Tz + sum(Tramp);
	step = gcd(Tz,Tramp);
	nsteps = Tcycle/step;
	if ( nsteps < nstepsmin ) {
	  /* The perfect answer has too few steps (Trecycle is too long)
