Need to replace reltimer() calls with timer_* calls

After determining 'which' soldrv we are, that will affect
the name we pass to Col_send_init() and what cmd node we
read from.

Read non-blocking, then use ionotify to get a pulse
create timers and get a pulse

Use Col_send(), but don't need to synchronize.
