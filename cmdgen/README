cmdgen package for generating command parsers for the
Anderson Group Data Acquisition System.

From a CVS checkout, you should be able to build via:

  autoreconf -i
  ./configure
  make

Note that the version of sed distributed with QNX4 is rather out of
date and cannot process certain constructs included in the configure
script. Specifically, it does not recognize semicolons as command
separators as used in the definition of $as_tr_sh. I have tried
using a ported version of GNU sed, but am running into another
problem there that I haven't tracked down yet.
