Basic Requirements for first-order implementation
  Collection
    Reads commands from:
      /dev/huarp/exp/DG or 
      /dev/name/global/huarp/exp/DG
    Sends data to
      /dev/huarp/exp/TM
    Sends commands to
      /dev/huarp/exp/TMcmd
  TMbfr
    /dev/huarp/exp/TM
    /dev/huarp/exp/TMcmd
    in realtime mode
  Clients without command reception
    logger (wants suspend/resume)
    display
    extraction
    algorithm

What are the advantages of using resource manager architecture
for TMbfr rather than GNS and basic send/receive?
  Know when all clients have quit, so get a more graceful
  shutdown.
  Clients can use regular open(), read() and write() calls, which
  can make them much more portable.

Try implementing the command channel with the goal of testing:
  Test Command Channel
    Single writer, multiple readers
    Multiple writers, multiple readers
    Clients starting and stopping randomly
