Would like to record datum spaces as well as width {
  Augment syntax of tmc text(var) to support text(var[,nspaces])
  Then tmc can report an error if the number of spaces does not match
}
Do Rules {
  Rules are done, but double rules don't look great. C'est la vie.
}
Configuration in phtable {
  bgcolor fgcolor
  labelfont face size style bgcolor fgcolor
  fieldfont face size style bgcolor fgcolor
  headerfont face size style bgcolor fgcolor
  titlefont face size style bgcolor fgcolor
  linecolor
  ColSpace (and glue?)
  RuleSpace
  Baselineskip?
}
Differences between phtable and table {
  Or maybe I still don't need to do that...
  Remove Overlay
  Add font attribute specifications
}
Add .clp {
  Specify -o option
  unlink output file before opening for write
  fchmod 0444 after writing
}

-Make 'Table' keyword optional
-Add named tables {
   MinDims get stored with named table's entity
 }
-Change Rule syntax to +?[-=]+?
-Rule Connection needs augmentation
-Eliminate TableOpts (Width/Height) but add Glue {
   Augment glue to include at least fill (0+0+1).
 }
-Alignment options
- Write token processor for C Strings starting with
  $elipkg/Scan/str.c
  
- Eliminate Box spacing {
	Do not support overlaying box with text
	HBox {
	  Rule;
	  Table {
		HBox {
		  Table { Rule; };
		  "This is the Title";
		  Table { Rule; };
		}
		"This is the real table";
		Rule;
	  }
	  Rule;
	}
  }
- Implement Glue {
	GlueSet( dim_t mydim, dim_t encdim ) {
	  Just uses width of encdim
  }
- Calculate actual Width, Height
- Calculate Row,Col Position
- Produce Output
- Deal with box intersections {
	Maintain a database of strings, calculate all intersections...
  }
- Introduce Attributes
+ Augment mkcstr to recognize octal escapes
