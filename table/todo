Try eliminating CHAIN in StringPrint, FieldPrint? {
  Or maybe not... Perhaps it is just as well to
  preserve order when generating output. No, CONSTITUENTS
  guarantees post-order visitation, which should be
  identical to the CHAIN implementation.
}
Differences between phtable and table {
  Or maybe I still don't need to do that...
  Remove Overlay
  Add font attribute specifications
}
Add .clp {
  Specify -o option
  unlink output file before opening for write
  fchmod 0444 after writing
}
Add Overlay { } construct to overlay Datums only: {
  Overlay : 'Overlay' '{' Datum* '}' .
}

-Make 'Table' keyword optional
-Add named tables {
   MinDims get stored with named table's entity
 }
-Change Rule syntax to +?[-=]+?
-Rule Connection needs augmentation
-Eliminate TableOpts (Width/Height) but add Glue {
   Augment glue to include at least fill (0+0+1).
 }
-Alignment options
- Write token processor for C Strings starting with
  $elipkg/Scan/str.c
  
- Eliminate Box spacing {
	Do not support overlaying box with text
	HBox {
	  Rule;
	  Table {
		HBox {
		  Table { Rule; };
		  "This is the Title";
		  Table { Rule; };
		}
		"This is the real table";
		Rule;
	  }
	  Rule;
	}
  }
- Implement Glue {
	GlueSet( dim_t mydim, dim_t encdim ) {
	  Just uses width of encdim
  }
- Calculate actual Width, Height
- Calculate Row,Col Position
- Produce Output
- Deal with box intersections {
	Maintain a database of strings, calculate all intersections...
  }
- Introduce Attributes
+ Augment mkcstr to recognize octal escapes
