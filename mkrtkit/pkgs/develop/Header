#   tmc/extmain.skel: Add hooks for telemetry
#   tmc: Straight recompile, side effect of extmain.skel update
#   tmpplib: typo in DC.h
#   appgen.mk: nctable dependencies
# 2.5.76 2017-07-12
#   appgen_module: Reverting change from 2.5.74. Decided there
#   is a consistent ordering of dependencies:
#     Build targets should depend on appgen-generated files
#     Appgen-generated files should not depend on their source
#     files. Instead, Makefile should depend on those source
#     files. Appgen will run and conditionally replace the
#     generated files and rewrite Makefile. Then make restarts
#     and will recognize the changed files. This approach
#     does mean that appgen will run whenever any of the
#     appgen source files is updated, but if the dependencies
#     are correctly curated, this should not result in running
#     appgen on every make or multiple times per make.
#     It is important to check that any custom code generators
#     invoked by appgen follow this logic.
#   QCLI.agm: Add RESET= parameter
# 2.5.75 2017-02-28
#   appgen: Support IGNORE variable to add files to IGNOREFILE
#   QCLI.agm, qclis.cmd.in: Allow specification of sampling configuration
#   QCLI.genui.in: Suppress text conversion as necessary
# 2.5.74 2016-11-07
#   appgen: appgen-generated files will now have their timestamps
#     updated even when the contents are unchanged. There is a
#     tradeoff between running appgen unncessarily and recompiling
#     unnecessarily. I decided to stick to one consistent model--
#     the one make uses.
# 2.5.73 2016-09-28
#   appgen: add extprefix for tweaking name of default extraction target
# 2.5.72 2016-09-26
