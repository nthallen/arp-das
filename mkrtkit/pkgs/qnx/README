The qnx package includes core operating system files
that we need on most systems, both flight and ground
support. These will be extracted from the /rtkit lists
as follows:

I will take all of:
  650-os.txt except for some usr/photon stuff
  650-fsys.txt
  650-net.txt
  650-gpl.txt
  650-multicore.txt
but will split them into MANIFEST and MANIFEST_x86,
depending on whether the source files are in the
x86 subtree or not.

I will review 650-complete.txt to see what from there
should be included.

  I don't need opt/webkit, but note that it includes
  a bunch of potentially useful libraries in
  opt/webkit/x86/lib

  Almost everything else should go into photon
  photon will also need the usr/photon stuff
  from 650-os.txt that we left out.

MANIFEST_other will include other basic utilities that
do not reside under /usr/qnx650/target/qnx6

gen_manifests will generate MANIFEST and MANIFEST_x86.
It needs to be editted to update the version (at least).
Header needs to be editted manually to update the version.
