The photon package includes GUI files required on
ground support systems but not on flight systems.

I will use the file listings in /fs/cd0/rtkit
as follows:

I will take:
  650-os.txt only the usr/photon stuff
  650-complete.txt but only those files not in:
    650-os.txt
    650-fsys.txt
    650-net.txt
    650-gpl.txt
    650-multicore.txt

    I will also exclude the opt/webkit stuff
    and a few other utilities

  650-complete.txt has leading slashes, so needs
  to be filtered first.

I will split these into MANIFEST and MANIFEST_x86,
depending on whether the source files are in the
x86 subtree or not.

gen_manifests will generate MANIFEST and MANIFEST_x86.
It needs to be editted to update the version (at least).
Header needs to be editted manually to update the version.
