# Package gpsd
#  The package version is currently not tied to the gpsd version
#  The gpsd build is based off of the main gpsd repo at
#    780c8a9c6bcdd1f8c904eaf28c11ceb317a0a2f7
#   which appears to be V3.16-dev according to gpsd.h
#  The ntpd build is from ntp-4.2.8p4.tar.gz retrieved from
#   http://www.ntp.org/downloads.html
#  The pps build was written by David Bacon and retrieved from
#   http://cs.nyu.edu/~bacon/pps/pps.tgz
#   The source code has been modified to explicitly look for PPS
#   on /dev/ser1 and not on /dev/ser2.
