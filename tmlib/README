tmlib is a utility library for Anderson Group-style telemetry data.
We are taking advantage of the migration from QNX4 to QNX6 to make
some modifications to the underlying data formats. As such, the format
of data under QNX6 will not be directly compatible with QNX4 data,
although it should not be difficult to translate between the formats.

The new architecture does away with the 'Data Ring,' replacing it with
a more robust data buffer implemented as a QNX6 resource manager. This
eliminates the distinction between data buffer clients and data ring
clients. Relative priority between clients can be controlled via process
priority levels.
