/* For QNX6, we don't need to establish a special interface to the driver. The driver will read ASCII commands from
   the appropriate interface of the form /dev/huarp/$Experiment/cmd/$Board
   Instead of transmitting the hsatod_setup_t struct, we will convert to ASCII
   However, I need to provide the struct typedef, because that is how qclicomp communicates with the
   command server.

   Since the communication to the server is handled by cis_turf(), all we need to do is
   provide the appropriate command strings.
